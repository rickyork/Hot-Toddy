# <h1>Documentation</h1>
# <p>
#   Hot Toddy builds documentation directly into every source file.  A parser then
#   tokenizes each source file and extracts the documentation, isolates objects,
#   object methods, source code, and documentation written into the source code and
#   stores all of this in a few database tables.  This approach has the following
#   benefits:
# </p>
# <ol>
#   <li>
#       It makes documentation easy to search, in just a few seconds you can
#       search hundreds of source files and thousands of methods.
#   </li>
#   <li>
#       Keeping documentation in the source files themselves encourages documentation
#       to be written with the source code, and maintained with the source code, so
#       there is less of an excuse for separately maintained source code files to
#       be out-of-sync with the actual code.
#   </li>
# </ol>

        # <h2>Displaying Documentation, Documentation Search</h2>
        # <p>
        #   The <var>hDocumentation</var> plugin is loaded for every page of Hot Toddy
        #   documentation you see.  It does things like include the style sheets, javascript
        #   and bring the various presentational bits associated with Hot Toddy's
        #   documentation API together.
        # </p>

        $this->hDocumentation = $this->library('hDocumentation');

        $html = '';

        $documentationFileId = 0;

        # <h3>Query Strings</h3>
        # <p>
        #   Query strings are used to link directly to documentation in Hot Toddy.
        #   For example: <var>http://www.example.com/Hot Toddy/Documentation?hDocumentation</var>.  The
        #   preceding path uses a query string to specify the path to the documentation
        #   file that you want to view.  The path that you specify is written as a
        #   Hot Toddy plugin path, which is to say, a path like
        #   <var>/Hot Toddy/hDocumentation/hDocumentation.php</var> becomes just
        #   <var>hDocumentation</var>.  And a path like
        #   <var>/Hot Toddy/hDocumentation/hDocumentation.library.php</var> becomes just
        #   <var>hDocumentation/hDocumentation.library.php</var>.
        # </p>
        # <p>
        #   Beyond Hot Toddy plugin paths, you can also use an <var>hDocumentationFileId</var>
        #   in the query string to link to a documentation file.  So if, for example,
        #   a file like <var>/Hot Toddy/hApplication/hApplication.library.php</var> has an
        #   <var>hDocumentationFileId</var> of 1, you can link to that file like this:
        #   <var>http://www.example.com/Hot Toddy/Documentation?1</var>
        # </p>
        # <h3>Methods as Anchors</h3>
        # <p>
        #   Each method in a documentation file is also set up to act as an anchor.  For example,
        #   you could link to this documentation as:
        #   <var>http://www.example.com/Hot Toddy/Documentation?hDocumentation#hConstructor</var>
        # </p>
        # <h3>"Private" Documentation</h3>
        # <p>
        #   Hot Toddy's documentation API also works with "private" plugins, so documentation
        #   written for business logic methods of a framework installation will also be tokenized
        #   and indexed in the documentation database.
        # </p>
