    Why is Hot Toddy's file system the most awesome thing ever invented? It is 
    because the Hot Toddy file system uses a database backend to track files and 
    documents. This makes it very fast, and searchable. Everything that a user 
    needs to handle documents is included. Every file in the file system can be
    access controlled. This means that permissions can be fine-tuned for the 
    audience. Files can be either public (world read), or permission can be granted
    to individual people, or permission can be granted to groups.

    The way Hot Toddy handles file requests depends on the type of file being 
    accessed. Every single file that is served by the server passes through 
    Hot Toddy, even JavaScript and CSS files used to develop Hot Toddy itself.
