# <h1>Retrieving File Thumbnails</h1>
# <p>
#   This plugin creates thumbnails of supported file formats.  Generally the
#    supported format is determined by the hImage plugin prior to making a
#   request to this plugin based on the capabilities of the chosen image
#   processing API, e.g., CoreImage, ImageMagik, PHP GD.
# </p>
# <p>
#   This plugin generally lives at the path:<br />
#   www.example.com/System/Applications/Thumbnail.plugin
# </p>
# <p>
#   Or perhaps:<br />
#   www.example.com/System/Applications/File/Thumbnail.plugin
# </p>
# <p>
#   The location of the Thumbnail.plugin file can be moved anywhere
#   you like and be referenced dynamically by calling:
# </p>
# <code>
#   $this->getFilePathByPlugin('hFile/hFileThumbnail');
# </code>
# <p>
#   This will output the path to wherever the file this plugin
#   is attached to presently resides.
# </p>
# @end
