#
# This plugin presently provides a method of accessing supporting framework files
# stored in the following locations:
#
# /Hot Toddy
# /Plugins
# /Library
#
# The supporting files are generally passed-through by setting framework variables
# that point the framework to the file and tell it how the file should be provided.
#
# This plugin takes extra measures with regards to CSS and JS files, CSS files are
# stripped of comments and excessive white space to compress the files for output.
#
# Most JS files are compressed using the 3rd-party Packer script.
# See: /Library/Packer
#
# Some exceptions apply, some JS files don't play well with the packer compression,
# so they are manually exempt from compression.  FCKEditor is one example of this.
#
# This plugin lives at the following path in the framework's file system:
# www.example.com/System/Applications/Library.plugin
#
# Or perhaps:
# www.example.com/System/Applications/File/Library.plugin
#
# (In theory) the location of the Library.plugin file can be moved anywhere
# you like and be referenced dynamically by calling:
#
# $this->getFilePathByPlugin('hFile/hFileLibrary');
#
# This will output the path to wherever the file this plugin
# is attached to presently resides.  (Regarding this particular plugin, this
# may or may not actually work, but the technique usually works with other
# plugins).

class hFileLibrary extends hPlugin {

    private $hFileJSCompress;
    private $hFileCSSCompress;

    # Third-party applications, scripts, css, etc, live outside of the document root in
    # a directory called "Library".  The framework automatically detects requests to
    # the /Library directory, and diverts those requests to this plugin.
    #
    # Additionally, a plugin's supporting files may be stored with it.  To make this
    # possible requests for files residing in /Hot Toddy and /Plugins are
    # also diverted to this plugin.  Both directories are referened in a common URI
    # www.example.com.  Whether or not this plugin looks in /Hot Toddy or
    # /Plugins is determined by the method getIncludePath(), which looks in both locations
    # for the file.
    #
    # A request to www.example.com/hFile/Pictures/something.png goes like this:
    #
    #  1. Look at /Hot Toddy/hFile/Pictures/something.png
    #
    #  2. Look at /Plugins/hFile/Pictures/something.png
    #
    #  3. Look at /private/hFile/Pictures/something.png (this is a legacy folder, don't use it)
    #
    # Whichever path actually exists first, wins.
    #
    # If a file will not load, it's possible the framework hasn't been told about the
    # file.  New types of files should be registered in the database table hFileIcons.
    # hFileIcons stores the MIME type, the extension, a reference to a PNG icon, and
    # a reference to a macintosh ICNS icon.  See hFile/hFileIcon for more information.
    #
    # hFileIcons is used to retrieve MIME types for files, which the framework uses to
    # set the Content-Type header.
