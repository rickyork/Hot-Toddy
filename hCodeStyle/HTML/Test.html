    <p>Performance and behavior issues should be addressed as soon as they arise.</p>
    <p>It is important to be consistent in the way that disciplinary counseling is handled
      for all employees in the department or office.</p>
    <p>A Human Resources Consultant can be contacted for assistance regarding an
      employee&rsquo;s performance or behavior.</p>
    <p>Discussions with employees should be done privately, face to face and must be documented.</p>
    <p>A <a href="/Documents/Human Resources/Manager Information/Performance Improvement Plan.doc">Performance Improvement Plan</a>
      form should be used to document employee performance problems.</p>
    <ul><li>
        The form should be used as a tool to improve performance as well as document
        the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is recommended that a completed Performance Improvement Plan be reviewed by a
        Human Resources Consultant before it is issued to the employee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Time frames or dates should not be used as this may be considered a guarantee
        or promise of employment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Employees should have the opportunity to provide a written response, but the
        manager should always retain the original Performance Improvement Plan. If employees
        want to make a response outside of the meeting, they should do so on a separate
        piece of paper or on their copy of the form. The response should be attached to the
        Performance Improvement Plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Employees should sign the Performance Improvement Plan. If they do not sign the
        form, a witness (preferably a member of management) should sign the form signifying
        that the Performance Improvement Plan was issued to the employee and he/she declined
        to sign the form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Employees should receive a copy of the completed form and the original should
        be maintained in their personnel file.
      </li></ul>
    <p>A <a href="/Documents/Human Resources/Manager Information/Documentation Log.doc">Documentation Log</a>
      can be used for a manager to keep records of discussions

  <h4>Family and Medical Leave Act</h4>
  <div class="AmHealthDepartmentIndentContent"><p>The Human Resources Department will process leaves under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
      It is the manager&rsquo;s responsibility to notify a Human Resources Consultant that an employee may be
      eligible for or may need FMLA leave.</p>
    <p>Employees may be eligible for leave under the FMLA after 12 months of service with American Health
      Network if they have worked at least 1250 hours in the previous 12 months.</p>
    <p>Eligible employees are allowed 12 weeks of leave in a rolling 12 month period under the FMLA, which
      provides job and benefit protection for the employee.</p>
    <p>FMLA leave is available to eligible employees for:</p>
    <ul><li>the birth, adoption or placement of a foster child with/of the employee; and care for the child;</li>
      <li>the employee&rsquo;s own serious health condition that makes them unable to work;</li>
      <li>the care for a child, spouse or parent who has a serious health condition.</li></ul>
    <p>Managers should contact a Human Resources Consultant if an employee*:</p>
    <ul><li>has/is scheduled for a surgery or treatment that will cause an absence from work</li>
      <li>has missed 2-3 days of work for his/her own illness or for an illness of a family member</li>
      <li>misses work often because of his/her own illness or the illness of a family member</li>
      <li>is pregnant</li>
      <li>is in the process of adoption or providing foster care</li></ul>
    <p>* This is not a complete list; if unsure of a situation, contact a Human Resources Consultant.</p>
    <p>Employees do not need to specifically state that they would like Family or Medical leave.
      It is up to management to offer it if they may be eligible.</p>
    <p>All completed FMLA forms must be forwarded to a Human Resources Consultant immediately.
      By law, responses to requests must be made within two business days.</p>
    <p>A Human Resources Consultant will advise the employee and manager whether or not the request
      for leave has been approved.</p>
    <p>If an employee is approved for intermittent leave (leave on a reduced schedule or intermittent
      basis), mangers should track the employee&rsquo;s days missed that are covered by the FMLA leave. An <a href="/Documents/Payroll/Attendance Record 2013.pdf">Attendance Record</a>&nbsp;form may be used for tracking.</p>
    <p>Employees must use any accrued PTO when using FMLA leave, unless covered by Short-Term
      Disability benefits.</p></div>

  <h4>Military Leave</h4>
  <div class="AmHealthDepartmentIndentContent"><p>American Health Network will comply with all applicable laws regarding military leaves of absence.
      Employees are requested to notify management as soon as they are aware of any military obligation.</p>
    <p>Regular employees may be eligible for pay differential for up to 14 days annually for required
      training.  Pay may be based on the difference between military and Company pay and employees
      must provide pay stub(s) from the government before their pay differential may be processed.</p>
    <p>Military reservist employees and those volunteering for or called to active military duty are
      entitled to reemployment with the Company upon their return from duty in full compliance with
      all applicable federal and state laws. In addition, besides the military leave benefits
      discussed above, employees who request a military leave of absence may elect to use any
      accrued vacation pay in lieu of unpaid leave, and may elect to continue health care benefits
      to the extent permitted by law, during their leave of absence.</p></div>
  <h4>Short-Term Disability</h4>
    <div class="AmHealthDepartmentIndentContent"><p>Employees with a non-occupational illness or injury may be eligible for Short-term Disability
      (STD) benefits after 12 months of full-time service with American Health Network.</p>
    <p>When an employee may be eligible for STD, he/she should be given an&nbsp;<a href="/Documents/Human Resources/Benefits/Short Term Disability/STD Claim Packet.pdf">STD Claim Packet.</a>&nbsp;The employee
      must complete the STD PTO Election Form, Employee Statement, and his/her physician must complete the Attending Physician&rsquo;s Statement. Completed forms should be sent to a Human Resources Consultant,
      who will complete the Employer&rsquo;s Report of Claim.</p>
    <p>A Human Resources Consultant will then process the initial claim with the STD carrier.  The
      manager will be informed when the claim has been approved or denied.  STD benefits will not be
      paid until the claim is processed and approved by the STD carrier.  Benefits will be processed
      through payroll for the next pay period.</p>
    <p>Leave under STD will also count towards the twelve week allotment of Family or Medical Leave.</p>
    <p>Employees must present a release to work statement from their physician before or upon returning
      to work. It is the manager&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure that this documentation is received.
      The manager should notify a Human Resources Consultant of the exact day the employee returns to
      work and forward a copy of the release to work statement.</p>
    <p>Any questions regarding Short-Term Disability should be directed to a Human Resources Consultant.</p></div></div>

  <div class="AmHealthDepartmentIndentContent"><p>It is the responsibility of the office to have and maintain a personnel file for each employee.
      The Human Resources Department does not keep personnel files for employees in the offices.</p>
    <p>All information in regards to employment should be kept in the employee&rsquo;s personnel file.</p>
    <ul><li>
        Required documents: Employment Application, Signed acknowledgement for Employee Handbook, Code of
        Conduct, and HIPAA
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional documents: New Hire/Rehire paperwork, Job and Pay Changes, Performance Evaluations, etc.
      </li></ul>
    <p>The files should be secured/locked and not accessible to the employees. Only those on a
      need-to-know basis should have access to employee information.</p>
    <p>Once a performance related document has been filed, it should remain filed. It is not necessary to
      release the document to the employee at a later time.</p>
    <p>All medical information (OSHA, Worker&rsquo;s Compensation, TB testing, STD/FMLA) should be kept
      separately from the personnel file.</p>
    <p>If the employee happens to be a patient, the patient file should be a separate file.</p>
    <p>Personnel files must be kept for 5 years after termination.</p>
    <p>All employment verification requests should be forwarded to the Human Resources Department.</p>
    <p>Employees wanting to review their personnel file should make an appointment with management. Files
      should be reviewed while management is present. Copies of the file&rsquo;s contents should not be
      made for employees.</p></div></div>

    <p>A Workers&rsquo; Compensation claim form
      (<a href="/Documents/Human Resources/Manager Information/Workers Compensation Claim Indiana.pdf">Indiana</a> or
      <a href="/Documents/Human Resources/Manager Information/Workers Compensation Claim Ohio.pdf">Ohio</a>)
      must be completed immediately upon knowledge of a work related injury or illness.</p>
    <p>To clarify whether an illness or injury qualifies as a Workers&rsquo; Compensation claim,
      contact a Human Resources Consultant.</p>
    <p>It is important that a Workers&rsquo; Compensation claim is filed immediately after the
      incident occurs. Delayed reporting can cause additional expenses for the employee, the
      office, and the Company.</p>
    <p>The claim form should be completed as thoroughly as possible and faxed to the Human
      Resources Department at (317) 580-6343. A Human Resources Consultant will send the
      claim to our carrier for review and processing.</p>
    <p>If the employee does not miss any work time and/or receives treatment within the office, a
      claim should be completed and the treatment information should be provided to the
      Human Resources Department with the claim.</p>
    <p>Employees filing a claim for Carpal Tunnel must obtain approval before scheduling surgery.
      Failure to do so may result in disqualification of a Workers&rsquo; Compensation claim.</p>
    <p>If/when an employee misses work to attend appointments for treatment of a work-related
      injury/illness, but is not disabled, the employee should be paid for the time lost.</p>
    <p>Mileage to and from treatment is compensable only when the employee is treated outside
      the county of employment. Reimbursement for mileage is from the employee&rsquo;s home
      to the treatment location and back. There is no reimbursement for trips to the pharmacy
      or other non-treatment appointments.</p>
    <p>Medical bills or supporting documents should be sent to the Human Resources Department
      on previously submitted claims for processing/payment.</p>
    <p>Workers&rsquo; Compensation will cover lost time in accordance with temporary total
      disability and temporary partial disability guidelines. Disability (lost time) indemnity
      benefits pick up when a person has lost time (any increment of a day or a whole day) for
      more than 7 days. This is defined as 7 consecutive calendar days or 7 non-consecutive
      days in any pattern from the same injury. Once that has been met, the wage loss benefits
      begin day 8. When a person misses more than 21 days, the initial 7 days of wage loss is
      paid as well. This applies to only those situations where a physician "disables" the
      worker by either (1) taking a person off work or (2) is imposing physical work
      restrictions or (3) is restricting the number of hours an employee can work.</p>
    <p>The Human Resources Consultant must be informed of the employee&rsquo;s status for the
      duration of the claim.</p>
    <p>Time off under Workers&rsquo; Compensation may also count toward the twelve (12) weeks of
      leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act that may be granted per leave year.</p>
