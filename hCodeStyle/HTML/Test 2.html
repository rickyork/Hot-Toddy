        Medicare covers two types of visits - one when you're new to Medicare and one each year
        after that. These visits are a great way to get up-to-date on important screenings and
        shots, and to talk with your doctor about your family history and how to stay healthy.

        The "Welcome to Medicare" visit covers new beneficiaries within their first year and
        helps you and your doctor develop a personalized plan to prevent disease, improve your
        health, and help you stay well.

    <h3>What is Medicare's Annual "Wellness" Visit?</h3>
    <p>
        If you've had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can come in for an Annual Wellness Visit to
        develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors.

        A few things you should know:

            be covered for annual Wellness visits after you've had Part B for 12 months.

    <h3>What should I expect during my exam?</h3>
    <p>
        During the exam, your doctor will record your medical history and check your blood pressure,
        weight and height. Your doctor may also give you a vision test and an Electrocardiogram (EKG).
        Your doctor will check to make sure that you are up-to-date with your shots. Depending on your
        general health and medical history, further test may be ordered if necessary. Your doctor will
        also give you advice to help you prevent disease, improve your health or stay well. You will
        also get a written plan (such as a checklist) when you leave letting you know which screenings
        and other preventive services you should get.
