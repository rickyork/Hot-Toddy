# Template Editor is a WYSIWYG designed to appear within any page of a given site,
# so that you can edit a document in place and see it update with the correct
# styling within the actual template as opposed to being loaded in a separate
# WYSIWYG editor outside of the site's template.
#
# This collection of plugins, JavaScript and CSS prefixed "hEditorTemplate" comprise
# the whole of the in-page or in-site WYSIWYG editor.  Some configuration is required
# to use this editor, such as defining templates.  See the hEditorTemplate..json
# file for an explanation.
#
# This plugin is completely separate from the hEditor and hEditorDocument plugins,
# which together made the framework's "Editor" application and only has the name
# "hEditorTemplate" because I couldn't think of a better name or location for it.
# This plugin may in the future be renamed or relocated to better distinguish it from
# the other editor application.
