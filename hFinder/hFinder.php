# <h1>Hot Toddy Finder Application</h1>
# <p>
#   Hot Toddy creates a virtual file system in the database, which is called HtFS, or
#   <i>Hot Toddy File System</i>.  It's a mix mash of files and folders from multiple
#   locations, both in the database and on the server's hard disk.  Hot Toddy creates
#   paths to <b>everything</b> on the server, but access to everything is controlled
#   using permissions.  For example, you have to be logged in and have <b>root</b>
#   privileges to be able to access files and folders outside of Hot Toddy, and
#   furthermore, Apache must also have permission to access files and folders outside
#   of Hot Toddy.
# </p>
# <p>
#   Hot Toddy's Finder, or hFinder, is inspired and modeled after Mac OS X's Finder, and its goal
#   is to present a graphical interface for accessing files both in Hot Toddy's
#   virtual file system and the real server file system.  Hot Toddy stores files, folders
#   and meta information in a collection of database tables.  The primary database
#   tables are <var>hFiles</var> and <var>hDirectories</var>.  These two tables store
#   the hierarchy of the HtFS file system.  To faciliate viewing files and folders in
#   the server's file system, Hot Toddy creates dynamic folders in its own file system
#   that act as gateways to the server's file system.  Some examples are:
# </p>
# <ul>
#   <li>
#       <var>/System/Server</var> This folder accesses the root directory of the
#       server's file system, or <var>/</var>
#   </li>
#   <li>
#       <var>/System/Framework</var> This folder accesses the root directory of the
#       Hot Toddy installation, which for this particular installation is
#       <var>{hFrameworkPath}</var> and this is the path specified in the framework
#       variable <var>hFrameworkPath</var>.
#   </li>
#   <li>
#       <var>/Library</var> This folder maps to Hot Toddy's <var>Library</var> folder,
#       which is <var>{hFrameworkLibraryPath}</var>.  The path to this folder is stored in the
#       framework variable <var>hFrameworkLibraryPath</var>.
#   </li>
#   <li>
#       <var>/System/Documents</var> This folder maps to Hot Toddy's <var>HtFS</var> folder,
#       which is <var>{hFrameworkFileSystemPath}</var>.  The <var>HtFS</var> folder is where
#       uploaded documents are stored.  Hot Toddy creates records in the database
#       tables <var>hFiles</var> and <var>hDirectories</var> that remember where users
#       put files in the HtFS file system, while keeping each file's content in a
#       cloned folder heirarchy in the <var>HtFS</var> folder.  For example, if you
#       were to upload <var>image.png</var> to <var>/{hFrameworkSite}</var> the file
#       <var>image.png</var> would be created in HtFS, in the <var>hFiles</var> database
#       table with the parent directory <var>/{hFrameworkSite}</var>, then the actual
#       content of <var>image.png</var> would be created at <var>{hFrameworkFileSystemPath}/{hFrameworkSite}/image.png</var>
#       and whenever <var>image.png</var> is accessed, it will be downloaded from
#       <var>{hFrameworkFileSystemPath}/{hFrameworkSite}/image.png</var>.  Having the
#       file created in the database file system allows for a multitude of meta information
#       to be attached to the file, including Hot Todyd permissions for which framework
#       users you wish to grant access to that document, as well as a plethora of other
#       information.  For example, you can track who's downloaded the file, attach
#       a password for access to the file, and so on.
#   </li>
# </ul>
# <h2>Reusing hFinder</h2>
# <p>
#   hFinder is designed to be a reusable application.  It can be embedded in other plugins,
#   it can be used as a dialogue.  For example, when you would like the user to open a document
#   in the file system, it can be used as an Open Dialogue.  If you would like the user
#   to pick a place to save a document and give that document a name, it can be used as a Save As
#   dialogue.  If you would like the user to pick a folder to be used for something, it can be
#   used as a Choose Folder dialogue.  Fair warning, however, any task involving the file
#   system should be reserved for advanced users that are capable of understanding the
#   concept of a file system.  Applications oriented to average users should completely
#   abstract the concept of the file system whenever possible.
# </p>
# <h2>The Tree View</h2>
# <p>
#   hFinder can be used with both the tree view on the left side, or both the tree and folder
#   views.  The tree view is available alone in the plugin
#   <a href='/Hot Toddy/Documentation?hFinder/hFinderTree' class='code'>hFinder/hFinderTree</a>
# </p>
# <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
# <p>
#   hFinder supports drag and drop of files and folders between multiple instances of hFinder open
#   in separate browser windows (if the browser supports the feature.  Safari, Chrome, and
#   Firefox do).  hFinder also supports drag and drop of one or more files from the desktop
#   or the desktop file system (again, if the browser supports the feature.  Safari, Chrome and
#   Firefox do).  And finally, hFinder supports drag and drop download of just one file at a
#   time from the browser window to the desktop or desktop file system, in this case, at the
#   time that I'm writing this, only Google Chrome presently supports this feature.
# </p>
# <h2>Database-Driven</h2>
# <p>
#   hFinder is considered to be core, essential funcionality for Hot Toddy, as it is presently
#   the only way to graphically interact with Hot Toddy's file system, and Hot Toddy strives
#   to make as much of its file system as possible database-driven so that files and folders
#   can be easily searched through using queries and database indexes.  When uploading files
#   through hFinder, Hot Toddy will automatically copy the content of office documents, Word,
#   Excel, Pages, Numbers, PDF into the database file system to make those documents
#   searchable via full text indexing in MySQL.  Beyond files names and the actual content of
#   a document, Hot Toddy also makes fields available for specifying descriptions, keywords,
#   and titles, which can be filled with any content you like.
