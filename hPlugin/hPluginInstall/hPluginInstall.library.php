# <h1>Plugin Installation API</h1>
# <p>
#    This plugin facilitates the installation of plugins by uploading a zip formatted
#    package.  These packages use the ".hot" extension instead of the standard
#    .zip extension to distinguish them from normal zip files.
# </p>
# <p>
#   This functionality makes it possible for users to easily install plugins from
#   third-party developers.  Plugins installed using the package method are always
#   installed to {hFrameworkPath}{hFrameworkPluginRoot}
# </p>
# <p>
#   Installing plugins requires the user to be in the <i>root</i> or
#   <i>Website Adminstrators</i> groups.
# </p>
