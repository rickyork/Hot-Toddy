Expression Tests:
  Simple variable:
    {@compare1?}


  With Parenthesis:

  
  
    {({compare1} == {$compare2})? Include }
    
    {({compare1} == '?')? Include?}

  Without Parenthesis:
    {{compare1} == {compare2}? Include content}
    
    {{compare2} != {compare3}? Include content}
    
    This should also work, in theory:
  
    {{compare4} && ({$compare5} || {$compare6})? Include content}
  
    {{compare} == "This is a statement to compare to"?Then include this.}
