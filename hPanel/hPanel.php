# <h1>Panel UI</h1>
# <p>
#    This plugin provides UI for creating panels.  Panels consist of one or more icons,
#    which can be clicked to launch an application inside of the panel UI.  Panel UI
#    provides UI elements for toggling between a running application and the main panel.
#    This looks and behaves similarly to Apple Mac OS X system preferences.
# </p>
