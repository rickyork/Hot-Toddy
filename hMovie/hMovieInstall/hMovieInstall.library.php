# <h1>Movie API Installer</h1>
# <p>
#    Installs the Movie API by creating three new categories:
# </p>
# <ul>
#    <li class='code'>/Categories/.Movies</li>
#    <li class='code'>/Categories/.Movies/Events</li>
#    <li class='code'>/Categories/.Movies/Movies</li>
# </ul>
# <p>
#    Then the program searches the Hot Toddy file system for 
#    all movie files and adds those files to base <var>/Categories/.Movies</var>
#    category.
# </p>
# <p>
#    The <var>/Categories/.Movies</var> category does not show up as a 
#    folder in the Finder, since this functionality could be broken or 
#    produce unexpected results if users were aloud to see or tamper 
#    with the category/folder.
# </p>
