Possible commands are:

    backup
    
        Create a backup of the entire framework installation by exporting the 
        database and then creating a zip archive of the installation.
        
        If a framework website lives at /Websites/www.example.com
        
        The backup is created at /Websites/www.example.com.zip
        
        Subsequent execution of the backup utility will update the existing 
        zip archive, rather than recreating the entire archive from scratch.
        
    truncate cache
    
        Truncates the hFileCache database table, which contains a variety of 
        cached data that is safe to completely expunge from time to time.

    cache

        Creates a copy of every publicly-accessible, static document in 
        document root, making Hot Toddy much more efficient by reducing 
        database and CPU load.  If used, this should be called every time
        Hot Toddy, or any static, publicly-accessible document is updated, 
        with the exception of user-uploaded content through hFinder, 
        which is automatically updated.
        
    cache php by force
    
        Updates cached PHP code.

        rid of orphaned database records as well as bad database records.

    export
    
        Exports framework data in JSON format.
        
        Example: ./hot export to /somewhere/framework.json
        
        If 'to' is not specified, framework data will be exported to 
        www.example.com/Temporary/hFrameworkExport.json
        
        Runs: hFramework/hFrameworkExport (.shell.php)

    help
    
        Displays this help text.  Also, any invalid command will display
        this help text.

    import

        Example: ./hot import from /somewhere/framework.json
        
        The 'from' argument is required.

        Runs: hFramework/hFrameworkImport (.shell.php)

    install
    
        Install a plugin.
        
        Example: ./hot install hFinder

    install icons
    install icns
    
        Copies all .icns files from the host Mac OS to /Icons/Source

    plugin

        Runs: hFile (.shell.php)
        
        This file is located at /hFile/hFile.shell.php.  If a plugin does not 
        have a '.shell.php' variant, the command will fail.
        
        Each plugin may require additional arguments.
        
        The command '--plugin' is a legacy command and provides the same functionality.
        
    sandbox

        Enter into sandbox mode. Sandbox mode allows you to execute Hot Toddy
