Sandbox Help

    The sandbox allows you to experiment with Hot Toddy API calls in the 
    context of a shell plugin.  You can type PHP code and execute that 
    code in the sandbox.

    - Type Hot Toddy code.  To include a plugin, do something like this:
    
        $file = $this->library('hFile');
        
      Something like this won't work:
      
        $this->hFile = $this->library('hFile');
        
      Since you are in the context of a plugin, member properties must be
      declared when including plugins, and declaring member properties is 
      not possible using the sandbox.
      
      Also possible:
      
        echo $this->getFilePathByFileId(1);
        
      Prints the file path for the file with fileId 1.

    - To execute code, type 'r', 'e', exe', 'exec', or 'execute' and press return.
    
    - To clear the code you've written thus far, type 'clear'.
    
    - To exit the sandbox, type 'exit'.

    Warning: Data changes you make using the sandbox are permanent and 
    cannot be reversed.
