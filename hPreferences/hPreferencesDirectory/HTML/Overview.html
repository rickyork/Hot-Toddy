  This utility makes it possible to join Hot Toddy to a network or local Mac OS X server, 
  enabling networked and local user accounts and groups to sync with Hot Toddy.  To use this
  feature with network accounts, Mac OS X Server must itself already be joined to the 
  directory using the Mac OS X Directory Utility.  Nothing further is required to allow
  syncing with local Mac OS X user accounts.
