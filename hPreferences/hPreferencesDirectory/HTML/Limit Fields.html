<p>
  You may also limit which directory fields can be edited directly by a user.  
  Any given field's information will still be updated within Hot Toddy, but 
  directory fields not enabled for editing won't propagate back to the directory 
  server.
</p>
<p>
  Changes made by a user to fields not enabled for editing within Hot Toddy will 
  automatically be reverted to the network directory version upon their next login.
</p>
<p>
  To allow all fields, make no selection.  To disallow all fields, do not provide 
  an admintrator's user name and password.
