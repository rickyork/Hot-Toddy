# <h1>Terminal Application</h1>
# <p>
#    Hot Toddy's Terminal application provides a command line interface for interacting
#    with the framework.  Presently, this CLI is very crude and only supports passing 
#    through terminal commands.  The goal with this application is to provide CLI support
#    for framework functionality in a completely custom web-based interactive terminal.
