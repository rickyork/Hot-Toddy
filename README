Installing Hot Toddy on Mac OS X.

The installer has not been tested on a Linux system, though it has worked on Linux in the 
past. It has been a very long time since it was tested on Windows, it makes extensive use
of shell commands like mkdir and chmod. Do not expect this framework to work with a 
Windows server. It is made for Mac OS X. It will run on Linux, it just won't have app icons
in the Finder app.

Hot Toddy makes use of OS X features, whenever possible, for example, it pulls out application 
icons from the OS to use as icons in framework applications.

To install Hot Toddy:

1. Copy and paste or download the install script to a new file called 'install'. The install 
script is located in the same folder this README appears in. Don't bother cloning the git
repository yet. The install script will do that for you.

2. Configure the install script with all the right settings. It should be obvious to you. Hot
Toddy is made for Apache and MySQL. Everything is hand tailored to a Mac, Apache, and MySQL
server environment. 

3. Make the install script executable with chmod 775.

4. Run the install script from the command line with root privileges.

 # sudo ./install


If you want to disable the OS X Server Apache install and use a custom install or MAMP, run 
the following:

 # sudo launchctl unload -w /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.serviceproxy.plist
 # sudo launchctl unload -w /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.server.httpd.plist
