<p>
  Documents on the website are managed using a web-based utility called Finder.  Finder is 
  inspired by and based on the document management utility found in Mac OS X of the same name.
</p>
<p>
  To launch Finder, simply navigate to the <a href='/Hot Toddy/Dashboard'>Dashboard</a> and 
  click on &ldquo;Documents&rdquo;.

</a>
<p>
  <b>Note: You must have administrative access to launch Finder.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Finder launches with a view that might look similar to the file system of your local 
  computer.  To keep things simple, some advanced features displayed in this 
  screenshot may be turned off.

<p>
  Files can be uploaded to any folder that you see here.

<h3 id='hDashboardUserGuidesBrowserSupport'>Browsers Support of Advanced Features</h3>
<p>
  While Hot Toddy is designed to support as much as possible in every desktop browser, some 
  features are so new to web development that they are not yet supported in every desktop 
  browser and in particular by a plain vanilla install of Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer 
  browser.
</p>
<p>
What isn&rsquo;t supported?
</p>
<p>
  The most useful features, of course!  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to drag and drop files from your desktop into the web-based Finder</li>
  <li>The ability to select multiple files for upload using the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; button.</li>
  <li>Editing documents on the website using the &ldquo;Edit This Page&rdquo; link.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I&rsquo;ll get to explaining the various ways that you can upload files in the next section, 
  but it&rsquo;s important to understand why all features cannot be supported by Internet Explorer 
  in general.
</p>
<p>
  Hot Toddy implements some cutting edge technology that has only recently been adopted by 
  some 3rd-party browsers.  One of those features is the ability to drag and drop multiple 
  documents into the browser window and upload those files to the website seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
  The browsers supporting these features are as follows: Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla
  Firefox, or Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer with the Google Chrome Frame plugin installed.  
</p>
<h3>Uploading Documents</h3>
<p>
  Documents can be uploaded to the website using one of the following options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Upload a single file at a time by clicking the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; button, or 
    the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; option from one of the context menus.  This option is supported 
    in all browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload multiple files at once by drag and drop from your desktop using a supported browser 
    (see previous section about Browser Support).
  </li>
  <li>
    Select multiple files for upload by clicking the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; button as you 
    would do when uploading a single file at a time, but select multiple files while browsing your 
    local file system by holding down the &ldquo;Control&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; keys on 
    your keyboard while selecting files.   This too only works with a supported browser 
    (see previous section about <a href='#hDashboardUserGuidesBrowserSupport'>Browser Support</a>).
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Uploading a Single File at a Time</h4>
<p>
  To upload a single file, click the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Finder window.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Upload.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Upload.png' alt='Upload a File' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<h4>Uploading Multiple Files by Drag and Drop</h4>
<p>
  To upload multiple files by drag and drop, select one or more files from your desktop or a folder.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note: The items that you select for upload may only be files, drag and drop of  folders is not supported.</b>
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Drag and Drop Desktop.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Drag and Drop Desktop.png' alt='Drag and drop from Mac OS X desktop to Safari' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  In the preceding screenshot, you see a file dragged from the Mac OS X desktop into the Safari browser window.  
</p>
<p>
  To accomplish the same with Internet Explorer on a Windows PC, you must install the 
  <a href='http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe'>Google Chrome Frame</a> plugin, which 
  will enable drag and drop from the desktop to the browser window.  Alternatively, you
  can install a browser other than Internet Explorer, such as <a href='http://www.apple.com/safari'>Safari</a>, 
  <a href='http://www.google.com/chrome'>Google Chrome</a> or <a href='http://www.firefox.com'>Firefox</a>
</p>
<p>
  After dropping the file onto the browser window you should see an upload queue appear, letting you 
  know that upload activity is taking place.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Upload Queue.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Upload Queue.png' alt='Upload Queue' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  <b>Note: While drag and drop is supported for uploading documents to the website using a supported 
  browser, this feature does not work in reverse, i.e., drag and drop of files or folders from the 
  Finder window to the desktop.  Unfortunately, no browser yet supports a way to do this.</b>
</p>
<h4>Uploading Multiple Files by Selecting Multiple Files</h4>
<p>
  The last option for uploading multiple files allows you to select multiple files when clicking 
  on the &ldquo;Upload File&rdquo; button.
</p>
<p>
  When you click &ldquo;Choose File&rdquo;, instead of selecting just one file to upload, you have 
  the option of selecting multiple files by holding down the &ldquo;Control&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; 
  keys on your keyboard to select multiple files for upload.  In the preceding screenshot, I selected 
  four files to upload.  Again, this feature only works with a supported browser.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Select Multiple Files.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Select Multiple Files.png' alt='Selecting multiple files for upload' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  <b>Note: Like drag and drop from the desktop, this feature only supports selection of one or more 
  files, and unfortunately, selecting a folder for upload is not supported.</b>
</p>
<h4>Caveats Regarding File Uploads</h4>
<p>
  There are some hard limits regarding the quantity of files that you may upload at once, and the 
  collective size of the files uploaded.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of files uploaded cannot exceed 500</li>
  <li>The size of all files uploaded cannot exceed 500MB</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The preceding numbers are theoretical limitations, and you will likely run into difficulty 
  as you come closer to these limits.
</p>
<p>
  Extremely large files can be added to the website, but should be added by other means.
</p>
<p>
  Since large files cannot be added using the web-based tool, adding large files requires the 
  assistance of your website's developers or administrators.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, since you are transmitting files from your location, across the internet to 
  the web server, bigger file uploads may take a lot of time to complete depending on the size 
  of the files involved and the speed of your connection to the internet.
</p>
<h3>Organizing Files and Folders</h3>
<p>
  Finder supports drag and drop within the window itself.  Files and folders existing on the 
  website can be moved and reorganized anyway you like by drag and drop.  Using a supported 
  browser, you can even open multiple Finder windows and drag and drop between them.
</p>
<h3>Renaming Files, Folders and Categories</h3>
<p>
  Renaming a file, folder or category can be done one of two ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Double-Click on the name of the file, folder or category in the right-side view and edit the name.</li>
  <li>Select a file, folder, or category in the right-side view and press Return or Enter on your keyboard, then edit the name.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hidden Files, Folders and Categories</h3>
<p>
  Finder uses a special naming convention to hide files, folders, and categories from view.  
  This feature is used to implement technical features within the website that regular users 
  should never see or interact with.
</p>
<p>
  Any file, folder, or category named with a leading period character will be hidden from 
  you and become inaccessible.   For example &ldquo;.hidden_file.pdf&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  For this reason, please avoid naming files, folders or categories with leading period characters.
</p>
<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
  Finder implements a few useful keyboard shortcuts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Control + R  / Command + R  = Refresh</li>
  <li>Directional Arrows / Tab (after selecting a file, folder or category) = Change the selected file, folder, or category.</li>
  <li>Control + Shift + Up Arrow / Command + Shift + Up Arrow = Move up a folder</li>
  <li>Control + O / Command + O (with a folder selected) = Open a folder</li>
  <li>Delete / Backspace = Delete the selected file, folder or category.</li>
  <li>Control + [  = Go Back</li>
  <li>Control + ]  = Go Forward</li>
  <li>Control + Shift + A  / Command + Shift + A = Open the Applications Folder</li>
  <li>Return / Enter = Rename the selected file, folder, or category</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Categories</h3>
<p>
  Beyond uploading and organizing your documents into folders, the website provides an additional 
  option for organizing files called <b>Categories</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Categories are distinguished from normal folders in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A file can appear in only one folder, but can appear in as many Categories as you like.</li>
  <li>Categories have green folder icons.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What is a category and why is it useful?</h4>
<p>
  Categories provide you with a way to both organize and tag documents.  For example, you may upload a 
  file and consider it relevant to &ldquo;Doctors&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nurses&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Practices&rdquo;.  
  Without categorization, the only possible option may be to upload the same document three times, 
  to three separate folders for &ldquo;Doctors&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nurses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Practices&rdquo;.  
  With categories, you upload the document just once to one folder, and then tag the file with the 
  categories you deem relevant.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, Finder actually keeps a record of every file uploaded and prevents you from uploading 
  the same file more than once.  If you attempt to upload the same document multiple times, Finder 
  will present an error letting you know that the document already exists on the website in 
  addition to where the file presently resides.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of uploading a document multiple times, you have the option to tag a file with as many 
  categories as you like.  Categories are simply additional meta data added to the file, making a 
  file easier to find and associate with different contexts.
</p>
<p>
  To categorize a document, you must first upload a document to a regular folder (blue folder icon).  
  This places the document in the website&rsquo;s file system.
</p>
<p>
  Once uploaded, you can drag and drop any file to a green folder to add it to that category.
</p>
<p>
  To remove a file from a category, right-click on the file and click &ldquo;Remove From Category&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
  Once added to a category, the file becomes available using the various category browsing and 
  searching options available on the intranet website.
</p>
<h3>Updating Files</h3>
<p>
  When you add a file to the website, instantly heaps of data about that file begin to be collected.  
  Who viewed the file.  The last time a person accessed that file.  Categories that file is added to.  
  Permissions applied to the file.  And most importantly, people will be sharing and bookmarking URLs to files.
</p>
<p>
  This enables features like searching your most viewed and most accessed documents.
</p>
<p>
  For this reason, when you update a file, it is a very bad idea to delete a file and upload its 
  replacement.  When you update a file in this way, all of that extra information is lost and you 
  have to start over with a blank slate.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, Finder supports a better way to update a file, which is done by clicking the 
  &ldquo;Edit File&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Finder window.
</p>
<p>
  To use this feature, first select a file by clicking on it in the right-side view, then 
  click &ldquo;Edit File&rdquo;.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Edit File.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Finder/Edit File.png' alt='Edit file' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  To update the file itself, select a replacement file, then click &ldquo;Save&rdquo;.  The new 
  file will be uploaded and will replace the content of the old file, but all of that extra
  information will remain in place.
</p>
