<p>
Access to most things on the website can be controlled and limited to specific people and/or 
specific groups of people, the process of controlling access to something is done by 
assigning <b>permissions</b>.
</p>
<p>
Permissions can be applied to a variety of items. You can limit access to a file, for 
example. But the concept of permissions does not stop at just files, it can also be 
applied to the folders that files reside within and things that don&rsquo;t have anything to 
do with files or folders at all, such as contacts in an address book, address books, 
calendars, forums, forum topics, and a variety of other things.
</p>
<p>
  Since permissions can be applied to a variety of things, the website abstracts 
  terminology by referring to all items that can have permissions applied to them as 
  <b>resources</b>.
</p>
<p>
Overall access to a a resource, can be controlled in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whether or not the resource is available publicly (without a login). This type of 
      access is called <b>World</b> access, because it means that you are controlling the right of 
      access of any person in the world with an internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items with World access can be accessed or downloaded without a login, and can 
      potentially be automatically indexed by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whether or not the resource&rsquo;s creator can access a resource. This type of 
      access is called <b>Owner</b> access, since it refers to the person who created the 
      resource.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whether or not the resource can be accessed by individual users, a type of access called 
      <b>User</b> access. Any individual user can be granted access to any resource.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whether or not the resource can be accessed by a group of users, and this of course is 
      called <b>Group</b> access. Groups can be made up of one or more individual people or may also 
      contain other groups.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Within the preceding types of access, World, Owner, User, and Group, you can further 
  control the type of access granted by selecting one of two options:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Read Access</b> - Allow the person(s) or group(s) access to look at or download a 
  resource, but not the ability to change it. i.e., someone granted only Read Access 
  does not have the ability to modify or delete the resource.
</p>
<p>  
  <b>Write Access</b> - Allow the person(s) or group(s) the ability to modify or delete 
  a resource.
</p>
<h3>Applying Permissions</h3>
<p>
  Permissions are applied by way of a universal &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; dialogue, and in 
  the context of files, folders, and categories, you can access the &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; 
  dialogue two ways.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Right-Click on a file, folder, or category and click &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo;, as demonstrated in 
      the following screenshot:
    </p>
    <a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Context Menu.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
      <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Context Menu.png' alt='Permissions Context Menu' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>   
      Select any file, folder, or category by first clicking on that item, and then click 
      the Cog icon in the top toolbar. This menu of options is the same you find when 
      right-clicking on an item.
    </p>
    <a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Cog.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
      <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Cog.png' alt='Permissions Cog' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
    </a>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once you have clicked on this item, you find the following window:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue.png' alt='Permissions Dialogue' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  This is called the <b>Permissions Dialogue</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The following is what the Users tab of the Permissions Dialogue looks like:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue Users.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue Users.png' alt='Permissions Dialogue Users Tab' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  In the preceding screenshot, you use the Users tab of the Permissions Dialogue to grant access 
  to specific, individual users. To find someone, click on a letter in the rolodex, A-Z. 
  Each person is sorted by their last name.
</p>
<p>
  To give someone Read Access, click the up arrow beneath the Users with Read Access box.
</p>
<p>
  To give someone both Read and Write access, click the double up arrow below the Users with Write Access box.
</p>
<p>
  Then, of course, the down arrows remove access.
</p>
<p>
  The following is the Groups tab:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue Groups.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Permissions Dialogue Groups.png' alt='Permissions Dialogue Groups Tab' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  In the preceding, any person in the group &ldquo;Website Administrators&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; can access, 
  modify or delete the resource, and the group &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; can only access the resource, but 
  not modify or delete it.
</p>
<p>
  Different groups can be created for the purpose of controlling access to resources, 
  who belongs to what group is controlled using the <b>Address Book</b> tool, pictured 
  below:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Address Book.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Address Book.png' alt='Address Book' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  The bottom of the column furthest to the right, shows the group George Washington belongs to,
  &ldquo;Website Administrators&rdquo;. While George Washington only belongs to a single group, 
  he may belong to as many as needed.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you can click on a group listed in the column furthest to the left to view the 
  members of that group.  If you click on the group &ldquo;Website Administrators&rdquo; you see 
  the following:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Address Book By Group.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Address Book By Group.png' alt='Address Book By Group' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>

<h3>Managing Permissions</h3>
<p>
  For the most part, you do not have to worry about manually assigning permissions to a resource.
</p>
<p>
  Where it concerns files, folders, and categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Files automatically inherit the permissions of the folder they are uploaded to.</li>
  <li>Folders automatically inherit the permissions of the folder the folder is created within.</li>
  <li>Categories automatically inherit the permissions of the category that category is created within.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The group &ldquo;Website Administrators&rdquo; is automatically granted Read and Write Access, 
  then the department group is also automatically granted Read and Write access.
</p>
<h4>DON&rsquo;T:</h4>
<p>
  Don&rsquo;t change or modify permissions for &ldquo;Website Administrators&rdquo;.  Changing the permissions 
  of this group will leave not only yourself, but everyone designated as a website administrator without 
  the ability to access or modify the resource.
</p>
<p>
  Mistakes can be fixed, but please avoid changing permissions associated with either of these groups.
</p>
<h4>DO:</h4>
<p>
  Feel free to add any individual user or group.
</p>
<h3>Distributing a Document to an Outside Person or Group</h3>
<p>
  Documents on the website can be easily and securely made available to people outside of your organization.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ways to make a document available for outside access:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Give the document Read Access under World.  This makes a document publicly available without a login.  
    DO NOT use this option if the document is sensitive in nature, as using this option makes the 
    document available to anyone in the world.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Using this method, you can transmit a web URL to the document easily, by right-clicking on a 
  file and clicking &ldquo;Email Link&rdquo;:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Link.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Link.png' alt='Email Link' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  The &ldquo;Email Link&rdquo; option starts up your mail client with a link to the document included in 
  the body of the message.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Link 2.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Link 2.png' alt='Email Link Message' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  If the document has World with Read Access applied, the person on the receiving end will be able to 
  simply click the link and open the document.  If the document does not have World with Read Access, the 
  person on the receiving end will be prompted to login to the website.  Then, after a successful login, 
  if that person has the right credentials, that person will be able to access the document.  If not, 
  the person will see a &ldquo;Not Authorized&rdquo; message and will be blocked from accessing the document.
</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Another, more secure way, of granting access to a document to an outside resource can be done 
    by assigning a password to the document.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You can assign a password to a document by right-clicking on the document and clicking &ldquo;Passwords&rdquo;.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords.png' alt='Passwords' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  The following shows the <b>Password Dialogue</b>:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords Dialogue.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords Dialogue.png' alt='Passwords Dialogue' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT: While there are clearly options for forcing a password to expire and what to do when 
  a password expires, these options are not yet enforced.  These features are planned for a future 
  revision.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Once you apply a password to a file, you can select the password by clicking on it, and then click the 
  envelope icon at the bottom of the Password Dialogue:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords Dialogue With Password.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Passwords Dialogue With Password.png' alt='Passwords Dialogue With Password' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  This will create an email with both a link to the document and the password the user should 
  enter to access the document.
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Password.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Email Password.png' alt='Email Password' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  When the person on the receiving end clicks on the link in the email, they will see something like 
  the following:
</p>
<a href='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Enter Password.png' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshotLink'>
  <img src='/hDashboard/hDashboardUserGuides/Pictures/Permissions/Enter Password.png' alt='Enter Password' class='hDashboardUserGuideScreenshot' />
</a>
<p>
  <b>NOTE: Transmitting a password by email is NOT secure.  Email is more often than not transmitted across 
  the internet unencrypted, meaning that a person with the right knowledge and skill could intercept your 
  email message and obtain those passwords.  If the document is sensitive in nature, you should remove the 
  password from the email message and provide the password to the receiving party by phone or some other 
  secured method.</b>
